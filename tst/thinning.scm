(herald thinning (algebra diffie-hellman))

;; This examples shows a problem with thinning.
;;
;; Skeleton 12 should lead to a shape, but a bug in thinning causes it
;; to be dead.  Adding one neq in the point-of-view fixes the problem,
;; and adding two causes the problem to re-emerge.  Skeleton 36 is
;; what is being erroneously thinned in the first run.

;; Blindvault provisioner

;; Diffie-Hellman algebra used so that bltk is available.
