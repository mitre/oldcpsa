; Unauthenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange

; In this example, the initiator and responder roles participate in a
; Diffie-Hellman exchange, and then a nonce is transmitted by the
; initiator and received by the responder.

; A man-in-the-middle attack is possible, because there is no
; attempt made to authenticate either of the parties.  Therefore, the
; adversary may emulate the responder to the initator and vice versa.
