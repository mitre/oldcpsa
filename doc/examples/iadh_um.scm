; Unified Model

; This file models the "Unified Model" method of determining a fresh
; key from long-term and ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exponents.  Since
; CPSA does not provide an intrinsic association between names and
; Diffie-Hellman values, we use digital signatures to link
; authentication of a Diffie-Hellman long-term public value to a
; public key.

; A role is provided in which a party signs a fresh long-term
; Diffie-Hellman value, and then leaks the exponent.  The latter step
; is used to test the notion of forward security.

; Two inputs are analyzed.  In the first, we model that two
; participants exist that agree on the UM key.  The notion of
; "implicit authentication" suggests that if one participant exists
; and another party knows the same key, that party must be either the
; participant or the participant's intended partner.

; In this version, we assume that the long-term keys of the
; participants do not leak.

; The second input checks whether the key can be learned when the key
; is generated honestly.  In this version, we do NOT assume that the
; long-term keys of the participants do not leak.
